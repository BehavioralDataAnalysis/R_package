# BehavioralDataAnalysis

** WORK IN PROGRESS! Please forgive the mess until the package is ready for release **


The goal of BehavioralDataAnalysis is to provide functions to help you analyze behavioral data, i.e., data that represents the behavior of human beings such as customers and employees. In particular, I believe that there are two aspects of behavioral data that are worth emphasizing: 
- it doesn't obey a normal distribution nearly as often as we assume. It can be asymmetrical (skewed), fat-tailed, kurtotic, present multiple peaks and what have you. 
- we're generally interested in understanding what causes a behavior, so that we can affect it--e.g., increase customer spending or reduce employee churn. This requires the use of experimental or quasi-experimental methods, many of which make our data even less "well-behaved", statistically speaking. 

Both of these aspects call for dedicated analytical approaches, which is what this package is about. I describe in more details this "Causal-Behavioral Framework", as I call it, in my book [Behavioral Data Analysis with R and Python](https://smile.amazon.com/Behavioral-Data-Analysis-Python-Customer-Driven-ebook/dp/B0979QYPWD/) (O'Reilly Media). But you can totally use this package without reading the book, and I've tried to make the documentation self-sustaining. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of BehavioralDataAnalysis from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FlorentBuissonOReilly/BehavioralDataAnalysis")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(BehavioralDataAnalysis)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
